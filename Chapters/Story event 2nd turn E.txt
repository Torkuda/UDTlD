73300 ＣＯＲＥ Ruled region――
73301 This way... my liege。
73302 Have you secured the area？
73303 Yes…
73304 The rebels have been swept up
73305 and the local populace expelled。
73306 Good, I knew I could leave it to you。
73307 I’m gonna take a small stroll around。
73308 Understood…
73309 Please be careful…
73310 Come、Let’s go。
73311 …………
73312 The two leave Truman behind and proceed to the ruins。

??test ingame - ? shorten

73313 While they walked, the horizon was lit ablaze
73314 by fresh fires and screams still filled the air 
73315 from the continued mass murder。
73316 That Truman fellow…
73317 He’s quite a show off isn’t he。
73318 Ah……
73319 Princess stopped abruptly
73320 Her gaze fixed on the edge of the road。
73321 Hm？
73322 King Core followed her gaze, there stood 
73323 a young boy. He was looking right back at them。
73324 The boy’s knees were trembling and shivering、
73325 but his eyes were burning with anger。
73326 What’s with that expression？
73327 Hahaha！
73328 Have we murdered your parents？
73329 Shut up！　You fuckin mom killer！
73330 Punk ass kid…
73331 That reminds me, do I actually have time to do that…

prolly wrong

73332 …………………
73333 Ugh…………You bastard！！
73334 The boy threw a rock at King Core。
73335 A small sound was made as the rock hit King Core
73336 and fell to the ground。

 rephrase


73337 …………
73338 Normally he would’ve killed him on the spot、
73339 but instead, King Core barely took a step。
73340 Fu- Fuck！
73341 He was angry at King Core、
73342 it was fury, rather than a show of courage。
73343 The boy turned heel and ran away。
73344 ……………
73345 …………？
73346 Princess tilted her head to one side in confusion,
73347 then looked at King Core’s face。
73348 King Core saw a ghost。A ghost
73349 of the past. During a time when 
73350 he was a boy, when he was still human――
73351 ・・・・・・・
73352 ・・・・・
73353 ・・・
73354 Lincoln, That was his name。
73355 As a kid, he always got into fights、
73356 no kid could lay a hand on him。
73357 He was innately talented. Proficient in
73358 martial arts and brash, he would challenge
73359 his seniors and adults
rephrase


73360 Even his abusive parents daren’t
73361 scold him. They thought he was
73362 a demon.
Even his abusive parents daren’t scold him. They suspected him to be a demon

73363 The neighbourhood boys admired him, It was befitting
73364 he became gang leader but no one knew how he truly felt。
rephrase


73365 In reality, no one respected him。
73366 恐ろしいだけだ。
Unnecessary statement ???? - How horrible/dreadful


73367 I have no one to truly love and care for。
73368 だが、出る杭は打たれる。
idiom - best policy is to keep your head down
suggested But it’s best to avoid such trouble?????


73369 自分よりも前に進む者が若ければ若いほど
73370 反発は強い。
?Profound quote
Suggested: It is better to keep moving forward when young than to fight back
Suggested: The younger the person is when he moves forward, the greater the repulsion 
Suggested ;The more a young person pushes forward, the more you have to push against.
Suggested; It is better to accept and move on rather than to linger.


73371 At the tender age of 8, he was sent to 
73372 a juvenile reformatory for assault. 果たして因果は巡る…
73373 The director whom he had assaulted was his father。
Very difficult to fit all info in 3 lines. 
果たして因果は巡る- 
One deed deserves another.
What goes around comes around.
Every action comes with an opposite reaction
At the tender age of 8, he was sent to a juvenile reformatory for assault. Like how one deed deserves another... the director of the school whom he had assaulted was his father.


73374 The director abused his power. 
73375 Little Lincoln believed he was treated unfairly。
73376 Never given enough food, struck with a whip。
Left to starve, struck with a whip


73377 Still,  he remained resilient which subjected him to 
73378 further abuse. He carved a tattoo in a shape of a mouse on his back
Again, alot of stuff to fit in to 2 lines. Must shorten and rephrase

Still,  his facial expression remained resilient which subjected him to further abuse. He carved a tattoo in a shape of a mouse on his back


73379 However, this was a fortunate event。The director got 
73380 fired after a prison guard outed him for holding a personal grudge and assault the boy
Again, alot of stuff to fit in to 2 lines. Must shorten and rephrase



73381 Lincoln’s penalty was reduced and eventually was released。
SHORTEN GODDAMNIT



73382 Now a free man, before returning home, he raided the
73383 ex-director’s home and relentlessly brutalised the man。
shorten, rephrase
73384 Due to this incident, no one dared to take action 
73385 against Lincoln as they feared retribution。
Rephrase. Vengeance can be used instead of retribution 



73386 より凶悪な菌をその身に浴びせられ、
73387 ラット<鼠>は世界に放たれたのだ。
No clue - I think it’s a creative way to say a terrible person has been released into the world.
Suggest: Worse than the most heinous bacteria being poured on, the rat was set loose into the world. 


73388 …………
73389 …………Was that a dream?…
73390 I guess I haven’t had enough sleep
might be wrongly translated
73391
73392 　　Ratatatatatat！
73393 「Uaaaahーっ！！」
73394 The sounds of gunshot ringed from behind them、
73395 the shriek that followed resembled the boy who ran 。
73396 …………Lets go。
73397 …………
