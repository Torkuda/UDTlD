Lines 156575 - 156845 - CORE Prologue
----------------

156575 LetÅfs make a promise -Å\Å\
156576 I will be your only friend
156577 And you, mine. 
156578 Never to trust in anyone
156579 Only ourselves.
156580 You are you, and I am me. It may
156581 sound strange, but I donÅft trust my partners
156582 You get what I mean, right?
156583 ItÅfs because you and I are partners.
156584 You understand, donÅft you? Princess?
156585 You understand that right?
156586 Hey-
156587
156588 Åw  THE Last Fools story  Åx
156589 ÅuYou have a human brain.
156590 Å@Don't you remember anythingÅHÅv
156591 Hu-manÅc HumanÅc Human?
156592 I remember nowÅcÅc
156593 I am Lincoln... a condemned criminal.
156594 I donÅft know why,
156595 but I was summoned from my prison cell.
156596 RepentanceÅHÅ@Such a
156597 foolish notion...
156598 After that...

Nel: I think the more accurate word would be ÅeconfessionÅf 
Need more input, I cannot remember - i think it was mentioned in the original story when you activate CORE

156599 After that...
156600 What the hell happenedÅH
156601 FuckÅAI canÅft remember a thingÅB
156602 He first checks his surroundingsÅB
156603 He seems to be inside
156604 Some sort of dock
156605 And it seems that
156606 There were no men other than me.

edit: there are no humans in this place aside from himÅB
need more opinion on which phrase sounds better
And it seems that in this place
There is no one else but me.

156607 WellÅc For now IÅfd 
156608 best get moving
156609 While muttering to himself, he casually
156610 tries to scratch his head
156611 Huh?
156612 He expected to feel his finger 
156613 scratching his head but couldnÅft
156614 He tried again and again but to no avail
156615 Hot, Cold, Pain, an itch, Not even a tickleÅB
156616 He could not feel anything
156617 What? How on earth did this happen?
156618 He looked at his palm in surprise.
156619 The flesh and blood coursing through his hand
156620 was all replaced with metal
156621 No, not only his hand.
156622 Everything intact. Arm. Shoulder. Chest. Abdomen. Legs.
156623 His whole body was
156624 replaced with metal
156625 Although I canÅft feel my 
156626 head with my numb fingers,
156627 I can tell something is weird/suspicious
156628 Those guysÅc
156629 Apparently while I was sleeping 
156630 some people have been fiddling with meÅB
156631 I canÅft feel a thing
156632 in this machine body...
156633 Bending down, Lincoln slammed
156634 his fist into the floor

With his waist lowered, Lincoln slammed his fist into the floor
Lowering himself, Lincoln slammed his fist into the floor

156635
156636 Å@Å@SLAM...
156637 The floor dents and a dull sound echoes.
156638 As expected, there is no pain and
156639 as far he can see, his arm seems to be undamaged
156640 Whoa, this is incredible
156641 From what I can see, this dock is 
156642 where mechanical soldiers like me are kept.

From what I can see, this dock is where mechanical soldiers are kept.
This dock... I can see, this body is apparently of a mechanical soldier from some place. 
*Nel: Not sure if the ÅeDo-kuÅf is talking about a dock, or a SFX lol
I can confirm that he says Do-ku. It is not SFX

156643 Hmph....
156644 This body ainÅft half bad...
156645 Lincoln laughed with his expressionless face
156646 He was prepared for death.
156647 Now, with this body,
156648 he had no regrets
156649 Not only that, this new body was suited to
156650 taking extreme amounts of punishment.
156651 The very thought of that made him happy.

Aside from that, this new body was accustomed to taking extreme amounts of punishment. Knowing this, made him feel ecstatic/happy/glad/delighted
Nel: Would sound perfect if heÅfs sadist lol. Probably more about how the body can take/sustain a lot of damage.<-- literal translation. above phrase is acceptable as it means the same thing. can be rephrased if you donÅft get it
 
156652 He then begins to examine his new body
156653 He checks his physical ability, function
156654 as well as his weaknesses and limitations.
156655 He soon finds a video recording device within him,
156656 with records detailing the events occurred 
156657 while he was unconscious.
156658 I see, CORE eh?
156659 Ha Ha, IsnÅft that interesting?
156660 Using the brains of criminals condemned to death.
156661 What a crazy thing to even consider.
156662 NowÅc The issue at hand, 
156663 Why did my memory return? No to co da gaÅc   ( SOS sent)
156664 You have a human brain
156665 DonÅft you remember anything?
156666 Hmph...
156667 You have a human brain
156668 DonÅft you remember anythiing?
156669 This was the last recordingÅc
156670 It seems like I had awoken
156671 right after this moment.
156672 I donÅft know the reason whyÅAbut
156673 but itÅfs worth trying out on 
156674 the other people in CORE
156675 Well, best get properly preparedÅc
156676 For the next 3 days, Lincoln combed out 
156677 the whereabouts of other CORE members like himself
156678 and showed the footage of Carol

 For the next 3 days, Lincoln combed out the whereabouts of other CORE members other than himself showing the footage of Carol
For the next 3 days, Lincoln thoroughly searched for other CORE members like himself and showed the footage of Carol.
*was shown/saw(?) a footage of Carol
 

156679 â ÇΩÇµÇƒîﬁÇÃì«Ç›ÇÕìñÇΩÇËÅAêlÇ™ãCïtÇ©Ç Ç§ÇøÇ…

**His reading was successful and returned himself to CORE in sequence before a person noticed and increased friends as expected.
His actions were a great success. With the people unaware, he returned the consciousness of other CORE persons one by one and built up his group of friends
ABOVE NEEDS REPHRASING


156681 Of course, there were those who tried to rebel 
156682 within the group but nobody was strong enoughÅA
156683 to defeat the merciless LincolnÅB
156684 Among the awoken CORE,
156685 two of them named Truman and Mckinley were
156686 picked to lead and execute the coup d'?tat...
156687 With CORE built into their lifeline, 
156688 the uprising catches Gamerika completely 
156689 by surprise. The coup de tat is a success.
156690 LincolnÅc 
156691 The military has been completely suppressedÅc
156692 New York is ours.
156693 So, Boss
156694 Now weÅfre against the world.
156695 îÑÇËÉ}ÉXÇ©ÅH

Ç≥Å[ÇƒÅAÉ{ÉXÅBÉRÉåÇ©ÇÁÉZÉJÉCÇ…ÉPÉìÉJÅAîÑÇËÉ}ÉXÇ©ÅH
So/Well, BossÅc Now weÅfre fighting the world. Urimasuka? (??Sell it?)
So, boss, is it a big sale?

156696 AhÅAbut before that
156697 ThereÅfs something we must do first.
156698 WhatÅfs that?
156699 A new body and face. 
156700 At this rate, itÅfs difficult to discern from each other

A new body and face. At this rate, itÅfs really difficult to know whoÅfs who.


156701 Roger that.
156702 WeÅfll get a former engineer
156703 to work on it.
156704 Get them to create one for you as wellÅB
156705 Are there any specifications for your body that you want?
156706 Mu Hohohooooo! NEW BADAAYYY!
156707 If thatÅfs the case, it would 
156708 be nice to have a design that
156709 can eat meat at any time. Human meat!ÅÙ
156710 For meÅc
156711 I want to be in the true form of my Almighty god.
156712 Is that all?
156713 You can do more than that.
156714 What about your form Boss?

Boss, what about your form/appearance?
What about you Boss?


156715 HmmÅAa Spartan body with a smiling face
156716 would be goodÅB
156717 A smiling face that would
156718 make everyone turn around.
156719 A few weeks later
156720 Sorry to keep you waitingÅc
156721 This is the SEX unit
156722 The signals from this pseudo-penis will
156723 bring about the same climax and pleasure
156724 A female unit prototype body is also, 
156725 according to the orders,
156726 being sent to the lab.
156727 Good...
156728 ì˜ÇÃâxÇ—ÇÕÇÌÇ©ÇËÇ‚Ç∑Ç¢
156729 âıäyÇæÇ©ÇÁÇ»ÅB

Alright/GoodÅc Pleasure of the flesh is a straightforward type pleasure isnÅft it.
This type of pleasure, the pleasure of the flesh, is easy to understand.
Still doesnÅft make sense. I donÅft understand this phrase. 
*The pleasure of flesh usually (and especially in this context), should refer to sexual pleasure. Meaning to say itÅfs easy to replicate the sensation and to be sent to the brain etc etc... (I guess lol)
wow, I really didnÅft get that nor do I still get how weÅfre suppose to phrase this
 

156730 So, is my new body?
156731 readyÅH
156732 Yes, over here...
156733 Please, change into it
156734 The CORE units are retrofitted, so that 
156735 even without the help of man,they are
156736 able to operate for a limited period of time

rephrasing required???? The CORE people are able to borrow and exchange parts (hands), they are also able to control another unit remotely for a limited period of time. 

156737 With his own hands, Lincoln pulls out
156738  the brains of the dedicated unit. 
156739 and replaces it with his own
156740 ÅcÅcÅcÅc 
156741 How is it? Is it alright?
156742 Åc ItÅfs good. 
156743 IÅfm please with with it. I feel great.
156744 I am glad you like it
156745 Mckinley-samaÅfs body
156746 is nearing completionÅA
156747 Would you like to wait a while?
156748 No, IÅfll return for now.
156749 I have a rendezvous with
156750 an old acquaintance.
156751
156752 Å@Å@WhooshÅc
156753 Yo, IÅfll be entering

Yo, IÅfm comin in


156754 Lincoln-sama.
156755 Thank you for waiting.
156756 HowÅfs the human?
156757 Over there, lying on the bedÅB
156758 The CORE member was pointing at the bed 
156759 where a girl was restrained.
156760  Yo, itÅfs been a while.
156761  Do you know who I am?
156762 ÅcÅcÅcÅc
156763 The girl on the bed nodded silently
156764 If thatÅfs the case, you should know
156765 what I want want to do

If thatÅfs the case, Do you understand what I want to believe in?
If so/If thatÅfs the case, you should know what I want/want to do/am thinking 

156766 Your needs as a person
156767 as of today, endsÅB
156768 You are now part of CORE. ÅB
156769 We are the same.
156770 No blood courses through our bodies
156771 However, your body is 
156772 specially made to feel pain.ÅB
156773 You will feel pain like a normal person when hit,
156774 No, perhaps more than a normal person
156775 You will be by my side,
156776 forever cared by meÅB
156777 That is of course as long as
156778 you know IÅfm not deadÅB

That is ofcourse, as long as I donÅft die.
However, I do not know when youÅfll die.<-- check translation. I think he is referring to himself. not princess
Direct translation is something like ÅeMoreover, itÅfs not like we know when we will die.Åf

156779 ÅcÅcÅcÅc

156780 On hearing Lincoln say such a sad thing
156781 a trickle of tears flowed at the 
156782 edges of the girlÅfs narrowed eyes.

The words of despair that Lincoln said made the girlÅfs eyes narrowed and a trickle of tears flowed over its edges.
 

156783 However, that was her only reaction
156784 here were no other signs of protest.
156785 ÅcThe next time you wake up will be in a mechanical bodyÅB
156786 ÇπÇ¢Ç∫Ç¢à´ñ≤Ç…Ç§Ç»Ç≥ÇÍÇ»ÅB
shorten
Next then to wake up  chance/moment/opportunity machineÅfs body da
To wake up in a machine body. ItÅfs a horrid nightmare at best.
This type of nightmare is the best. (wtf, I donÅft really understand this but ah well, another literal translation)
 
156787 The next day -
156788 The CORE army flagship
156789 HmphÅc
156790 This body is designed
156791 in such a bad tasteÅB
156792 Hi, Boss!
156793 I am able to taste and savor human meat.
156794 Very very good body desu!
156795 With this formÅc
156796 I as a god,
156797 will guide the people to salvation.
156798 Well, with this 
156799 it is easier to discern each other than before

156808 Her name is Princess.
156809 From today, she will be at my side.
156810 Well, it is easier to
156811 think of her as a puppy.
156812 However, only I am allowed to 
156813 to touch her.
156814 You guys, are not allowed
156815 to lay one finger on her.

No idea
