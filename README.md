Welcome to the Unofficial Daiteikoku Translation Division on Github!!

will file be overwritten?

Please wait while I organise the stuff nice and proper and try plan this all out...

Below was the original update page from googledocs

I have organised the document in chunks (the lines are organised in clicks ingame) so that it’s a little easier to add your edits wherever without messing other ppls work

	Lines are organised like so:

#######(line no. on txt file) Original Japanese text
#######(line no. on txt file) Draft translation

Comments, remarks, feedback, suggested lines of above line

	b. If you plan on editing and changing something HIGHLIGHT IT with a different colour so everyone can see what you’ve added/changed. Add a highlight with a comment/remark on the change


3. Those with edit rights, Be responsible.  Backups are made on my computer frequently but if someone decides to mess things up, it may be fucked forever - please edit responsibly. I’m trusting you....

4. Important updates, or things you WANT me to see must be written in the main update section below. News on my own or other ppls status can be written there as well. I might make a highlight colour legend there.

5. Don’t forget to put your name on where your comments are so I know who the fuck I’m talkin to!

6. Lets keep this ball rollin and aim for 100% full translation!

MAIN UPDATE PAGE

Hi everyone, content still very raw. If you feel anything needs rephrasing, feel free to comment. Feel free to add your comments to this page. translated sentences are written as close to its japanese counterpart as possible to avoid loss of meaning but if you feel creative and are able to rephrase it and still fit within the alloted lines, feel free to do so!- Torky

Our Primary Objective:
1. To completely translate the CORE chapter. This includes:
	Story and events in CORE chapter
	All H-scenes in CORE chapter

Thankfully, there’s very little story lol. Alot of NSFW h-scenes though!
